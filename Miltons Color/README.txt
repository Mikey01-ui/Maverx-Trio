These files are currently individual pieces.
Most of the HTML code in terms of the structure of it, should roughly be the same across them,
but there may be slight differences.
Not all the functions are standardized across them, and for now some may be missing entirely,
or only be partially functional.
Once we get feed back on the color scheme choice, then we need to make these all cohesive,
with the final version of the front of flow being nice and consistent across the pages for the user,
and in the codebase itself as well.
